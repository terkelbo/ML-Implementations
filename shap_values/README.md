# A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions

This is a implemenetation of the kernel shap algorithm described in the paper [A Unified Approach to Interpreting Model Predictions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.07874) by Lundberg and Lee.
The code currently implements the following algorithms:
1. Kernel SHAP
2. Linear SHAP (In the test case of kernel shap this is developed as a special case of kernel shap)
