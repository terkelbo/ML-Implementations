# Classication and Regression Trees (CART) for Machine Learning

This is a python implementation of the CART algorithm for binary classication and regression trees. The algorithm is based on the description in the book "Elements of Statistical Learning" by Hastie, Tibshirani and Friedman.

### Pruning

The implementation of the cost-complexity pruning is still work in progress and is not fully implemented.

# TODOs

- [ ] Implement cost-complexity pruning
- [ ] Implement cross-validation for pruning
